# soil-classifier

## Description
This is a soil classifier that uses Python to classify images of soil into both soil texture and color categories, which are used to generate a soil health metric. This model utilizes TensorFlow image classification and has been trained on datasets consisting of soil images that are categorized as Black, Laterite, Cinder, or Yellow and Silt, Sand, or Gravel. Given an image, this model correctly identifies the color and texture of the soil and uses these classifications to calculate an overall health metric, which can be helpful in identifying soil that is vulnerable to soil erosion.
